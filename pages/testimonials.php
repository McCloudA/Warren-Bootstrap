          <h2>Leah Jones</h2>
          <blockquote>“Warren embodies all of the qualities that I personally look for in a fitness instructor– motivational, exuberant, gracious, non–judgmental, exceedingly knowledgeable of his craft(s), and passionate about helping others realize their potential. He is additionally a gifted dancer and expressive mover– watching him play with movement is often inspirational in and of itself and always a joy. If you’re looking for someone to hone in on your specific goals and commit whole-heartedly to helping you achieve those goals, Warren is your guy.”</blockquote>

          <h2>Aaron McCloud</h2>
          <blockquote>“Warren Woo is simply an excellent instructor. He’s light hearted, fun, and his understanding of how the human body moves (and how to explain it) is impressive. If you’re just starting yoga, or want to improve your practice and move better, I recommend you get Warren to teach you.”</blockquote>

          <h2>Leah Vendl</h2>
          <blockquote>“Each session with Warren is exactly what I need. He takes whatever I’m working with and stretches it, growing me towards my expressed goals. Using his alignment expertise and dancer sensibility, Warren works with my body’s own power and breath to bring my movement into harmony with myself.”</blockquote>

          <h2>Lisa Steele</h2>
          <blockquote>“Warren is an absolute delight as a yoga teacher. He moved through the 2011/12 Yogalife Teacher Training program as he moves through life: with openness, grace and heart. Warren’s physical abilities and dance background/training contribute to his fluidly challenging classes and fresh, interesting sequencing. However, by inviting students to stay present, be real and breathe, he makes a connection with and makes it safe for all participants, regardless of experience or ability. Warren might be a new teacher, but his playful humor and insightful reminders combine to make a fun, creative and frankly inspiring class. Warren’s classes will leave you fulfilled, and probably smiling.”</blockquote>
